# BDSP-PlayerBundleCompare
A tool for quickly getting specific information from two different field player assetbundles at once.

# Prerequisites
Technically you don't *need* other software to use this however it's designed to be used with a vanilla BDSP Player Field Character and a custom one made in Unity and has been put through LumiTool. You then use this tool to have quick access to information that you enter by hand with UABEA.
- [Unity 2019.4.27f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2019.4.27)

- [UABEA](https://github.com/nesrak1/UABEA)

# How to use
Launch the software and load a vanilla bundle, for example fc0001_00, as File 1 and your custom bundle as File 2. Select Bones or Materials and Mesh and then select Load Data to load the list of SkinnedMeshRenderers that both of them have with the same names. You can also Swap between Lucas and Dawn to change the fixed cheat sheet data for easy copy pasting.
